## Overview

[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) is a multinational e-commerce company providing a platform for online stores and retail point-of-sale systems. They currently [accept](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/additional-payment-methods/cryptocurrency) cryptocurrency payments via payment methods like [Coinbase Commerce](https://commerce.coinbase.com/integrate/shopify), but none of these integrations currently support XRP or other currencies (e.g. SOLO) on the XRP Ledger. Furthermore, there are integrations with specific cryptocurrency wallets like [Strike](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/19/shopify-expands-crypto-payment-options-with-cryptocom-pact/), but again, this wallet does not support XRP.
